## What is ES6?

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the 6th edition of the ECMAScript language specification. It introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript, making the language more powerful and easier to work with. ES6 is a significant update to the language, setting the foundation for future improvements.

## New Features Introduced in ES6

ES6 introduced numerous new features, including but not limited to:
- Block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`)
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Default parameters
- Rest and spread operators
- Destructuring assignments
- Classes and modules
- Enhanced object literals
- Promises
- Iterators and generators

These features help developers write more concise, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Variables and Constants

### Difference Between a Constant and a Variable

In JavaScript, a **variable** is a symbolic name for a value that can be reassigned throughout the program. Variables are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

A **constant**, on the other hand, is a value that cannot be reassigned once it is set. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword. Attempting to reassign a constant results in a TypeError.

### Block-Scoped Variables

With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript now has block-scoped variables, declared using `let` and `const`. Unlike `var`, which is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are confined to the block in which they are defined, making them safer to use in loops and conditional statements.

```javascript
{
  let x = 2;
  const y = 3;
  // x and y exist only within this block
}
```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a new way to define functions in ES6. They are more concise than traditional function expressions and have a lexical `this` binding, meaning they inherit `this` from the surrounding code.

### Function Parameters Default to Arrow Functions

Arrow functions simplify the syntax when working with functions, especially when handling function parameters. You can set default values for parameters directly within the arrow function.

```javascript
const greet = (name = 'User') => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## Rest and Spread Function Parameters

The rest (`...`) and spread (`...`) operators in ES6 allow you to handle function parameters more flexibly.

- **Rest Parameters**: Collects all remaining parameters into an array.
- **Spread Operator**: Expands an array into individual elements.

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
  return args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(...numbers); // 1 2 3
```

## String Templating in ES6

String templating, introduced in ES6 with template literals, allows you to embed expressions within strings, using backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes. This makes it easier to create multi-line strings and include variables directly within strings.

```javascript
const name = 'Alice';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6

ES6 introduced several enhancements for object creation and property management:

- **Shorthand Property Names**: Allows you to create objects more concisely when the property name matches the variable name.
- **Computed Property Names**: Allows you to use expressions as property names within object literals.
- **Method Shorthand**: Allows defining methods in an object without the `function` keyword.

```javascript
const x = 10;
const obj = {
  x, // Shorthand property name
  ['prop_' + x]: x, // Computed property name
  method() { // Method shorthand
    return this.x;
  }
};
```

## Iterators and for-of Loops

ES6 introduced iterators, a protocol for creating objects that can be iterated over. The `for-of` loop is a new way to loop over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, and sets, providing a cleaner and more readable syntax.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // Logs 1, 2, 3
}
```
